# Support Vector Machine and Chi Square Feature Selection on Predicting titanic Dataset
This is the code that predict people who survived on titanic ship incident. The dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data. The data has some variables, those are:
1. survival (0 or 1): Count of people who survived.
2. pclass (1, 2, or 3): Ticket class
3. sex : Sex

6. parch: parents / children aboard the titanic
7. ticket: Ticket number
8. fare: Passanger fare
9. cabin: Cabin number
10. embarked (C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton): Port of embarkation

Developer use Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda that installed in VS Code. So we make the program using VS Code. This code is also can be ran in google colab or kaggle it self.
